        I hope the above image is school appropriate because its the most recent picture of me actually doing an activity.
        I hope to become a better critical thinker when it comes to coding when I finish IS 413. I hope that this class teaches me how to be
        a better programmer, and even if I don't pursue a job that uses C# or ASP.NET, I hope this class contributes to my ability to learn
        new platforms and languages quickly and efficiently. One of the most important skills to have in the tech industry is the ability to 
        learn powerful technologies as they come out and adapt to what companies use in their technology infrastructure, and IS 413 will surely
        be a great help in gaining that ability.
